# The Principles

- set your objective
- learn because you like that
- success comes with time and effort
- learning rhymes with failing, everyone sucks at first

## Compound Learning

Aiming at small progress every day is better than trying to understand as much as possible as fast as possible.  
It's like trying to grow big muscles in a few weeks by lifting heavy weights every day until exhaustion.  
Your body needs time to rest, and time to grow muscle. If you try too hard and don't rest enough, you'll fail.  

Alan Weiss: "Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good."  

## The Pareto principle

The Pareto principle is also known as the 80/20 rule.  
It's the idea that roughly 80% of the results usually come from 20% of the inputs.  
It's about reducing the 100% of something down to the core 20% that allow us to understand most of it.  

To master the art of coding, we only need to focus on the skills that truly matter.  

## Skill Stacking

To become a successful web dev, you need to:
- speak english
- be good at programming
- keep up with new technologies
- learn from other developers
- understand the customer needs

All of these skills stack up to make you more valuable than someone who masters only one or two of them.  
Maybe you're not the best programmer in the world, but your skill stack is what makes you very special.  

The art of skill stacking is to pick up skills that combine well, that get you closer to your professional objectives.

# The 4 Pillars 

## Everything is a game

- Try
- Fail
- Learn from your mistakes
- Try again by applying what you've learnt
- Repeat until you've learnt enough

## Feynman Technique

To be sure you master a topic, try and teach it to someone else, ideally someone who doesn't know a damn thing about it, like a child.  
Stop using fancy technical words, and try using simple terms instead, to prevent yourself from hiding behind concepts you don't really understand.  

## Trunk Based Knowledge

Strong **fundamentals** are very important, those are the **roots** required to build new knowledge from.  
The trunk represents intermediate concepts in this analogy, or concepts that allow us to tie the fundamentals to more advanced notions.  
Don't learn advanced or expiring concepts (the leaves) before you master the fundamentals and intermediate concepts, or the tree won't last.  

## Efficiency trumps grit

It's not about who works the hardest, or who puts in the most time.  
It's about who uses time efficiently, who uses the right strategies to grow in the most optimal way.

# The Science 

## Focus vs Diffuse Mode

The most efficient way of learning is by going back and forth between these 2 modes.  
Our brain needs us to focus then rest, focus then rest, ...  
Avoid multitasking.

## The science of sleep

Nothing new here.

## Brain training

- Keep learning new things every day to make your brain create new neurons and new neural connections
- Have some physical exercise because it helps your brain being in diffuse mode

## The science of feedback

Basically, positive feedback is important for beginners to progress.  
For experts, negative feedback is what they need to keep getting better.  
In both cases, feedback is crucial for learning more efficiently, preferably immediate feedback.

## Short and Long term memory

### Long term memory

Long term memory is formed by practising and repeating.  
Long term memory is extremely important when it comes to knowledge and learning, because that's where you store fundamental concepts and principles that guide your life.  

### Short term memory

How do we build this long term memory in the first place?  
We need to start off with short term memory, which is also called "working memory".  

To move knowledge from short term memory to long term memory, we need to use "**spaced repetition**".  
Doing something 20 times in one day is far less efficient than doing the same thing one time over 20 days.  

We know that short term memory is for something that you're currently working on.  
And you can bring long term memory into your working memory in order to solve problems, consolidating your long term memory.  

To improve knowledge acquisition and retention, new information must be consolidated and securely stored in our long term memory.  

**NOTE**:  
In this course, we can think of Short Term Memory and Working Memory as the same thing.  
However for those interested in the details you can read about the specific differences here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/

## Active vs Passive Learning

Obviously, active learning is what you need to do in order to become an efficient learner.  
You need to practise, to take notes, to try and solve problems on your own.  

Trying to recall what you've learnt before actually checking if you remembered right is also very important.  

**Practising** and **Recalling** are the 2 most efficient ways of learning. 

## The Science of Motivation

### Intrinsic motivation

We want to progress so we can:
- gain autonomy
- reach mastery
- have a purpose

### Extrinsic motivation

Like money, or any kind of external reward.  

## Goals

Eliminate the fear of failure by taking small steps.   
"Kaizen" is a japanese word for continuous small incremental improvements.  

A famous book about this idea of compound learning = "Atomic Habits"
