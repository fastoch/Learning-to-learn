## Compound Learning

Aiming at small progress every day is better than trying to understand as much as possible as fast as possible.  
It's like trying to grow big muscles in a few weeks by lifting heavy weights every day until exhaustion.  
Your body needs time to rest and time to grow muscle. If you don't take your time you will get injured and fail.
