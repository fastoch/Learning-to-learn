# The Principles

- set your objective
- learn because you like that
- success comes with time and effort
- learning rhymes with failing, everyone sucks at first

## Compound Learning

Aiming at small progress every day is better than trying to understand as much as possible as fast as possible.  
It's like trying to grow big muscles in a few weeks by lifting heavy weights every day until exhaustion.  
Your body needs time to rest, and time to grow muscle. If you try too hard and don't rest enough, you'll fail.  

Alan Weiss: "Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good."  

## The Pareto principle

The Pareto principle is also known as the 80/20 rule.  
It's the idea that roughly 80% of the results usually come from 20% of the inputs.  
It's about reducing the 100% of something down to the core 20% that allow us to understand most of it.  

To master the art of coding, we only need to focus on the skills that truly matter.  

## Skill Stacking

To become a successful web dev, you need to:
- speak english
- be good at programming
- keep up with new technologies
- learn from other developers
- understand the customer needs

All of these skills stack up to make you more valuable than someone who masters only one or two of them.  
Maybe you're not the best programmer in the world, but your skill stack is what makes you very special.  

The art of skill stacking is to pick up skills that combine well, that get you closer to your professional objectives.

# The 4 Pillars 

## Everything is a game

- Try
- Fail
- Learn from your mistakes
- Try again by applying what you've learnt
- Repeat until you've learnt enough

## Feynman Technique

To be sure you master a topic, try and teach it to someone else, ideally someone who doesn't know a damn thing about it, like a child.  
Stop using fancy technical words, and try using simple terms instead, to prevent yourself from hiding behind concepts you don't really understand.
