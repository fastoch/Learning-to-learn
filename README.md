# The Principles

- set your objective
- learn because you like that
- success comes with time and effort
- learning rhymes with failing, everyone sucks at first

## Compound Learning

Aiming at small progress every day is better than trying to understand as much as possible as fast as possible.  
It's like trying to grow big muscles in a few weeks by lifting heavy weights every day until exhaustion.  
Your body needs time to rest, and time to grow muscle. If you try too hard and don't rest enough, you'll fail.  

Alan Weiss: "Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good."  

## The Pareto principle

The Pareto principle is also known as the 80/20 rule.  
It's the idea that roughly 80% of the results usually come from 20% of the inputs.  
It's about reducing the 100% of something down to the core 20% that allow us to understand most of it.  

To master the art of coding, we only need to focus on the skills that truly matter.  

## Skill Stacking

To become a successful web dev, you need to:
- speak english
- be good at programming
- keep up with new technologies
- learn from other developers
- understand the customer needs

All of these skills stack up to make you more valuable than someone who masters only one or two of them.  
Maybe you're not the best programmer in the world, but your skill stack is what makes you very special.  

The art of skill stacking is to pick up skills that combine well, that get you closer to your professional objectives.

# The 4 Pillars 

## Everything is a game

- Try
- Fail
- Learn from your mistakes
- Try again by applying what you've learnt
- Repeat until you've learnt enough

## Feynman Technique

To be sure you master a topic, try and teach it to someone else, ideally someone who doesn't know a damn thing about it, like a child.  
Stop using fancy technical words, and try using simple terms instead, to prevent yourself from hiding behind concepts you don't really understand.  

## Trunk Based Knowledge

Strong **fundamentals** are very important, those are the **roots** required to build new knowledge from.  
The trunk represents intermediate concepts in this analogy, or concepts that allow us to tie the fundamentals to more advanced notions.  
Don't learn advanced or expiring concepts (the leaves) before you master the fundamentals and intermediate concepts, or the tree won't last.  

## Efficiency trumps grit

It's not about who works the hardest, or who puts in the most time.  
It's about who uses time efficiently, who uses the right strategies to grow in the most optimal way.

# The Science 

## Focus vs Diffuse Mode

The most efficient way of learning is by going back and forth between these 2 modes.  
Our brain needs us to focus then rest, focus then rest, ...  
Avoid multitasking, that doesn't work.

## The science of sleep

Nothing new here.

## Brain training

- Keep learning new things every day to make your brain create new neurons and new neural connections
- Have some physical exercise because it helps your brain being in diffuse mode

## The science of feedback

Basically, positive feedback is important for beginners to progress.  
For experts, negative feedback is what they need to keep getting better.  
In both cases, feedback is crucial for learning more efficiently, preferably immediate feedback.

## Procrastination

## Short and Long term memory

### Long term memory

Long term memory is formed by practising and repeating.  
Long term memory is extremely important when it comes to knowledge and learning, because that's where you store fundamental concepts and principles that guide your life.  

### Short term memory

How do we build this long term memory in the first place?  
We need to start off with short term memory, which is also called "working memory".  

To move knowledge from short term memory to long term memory, we need to use "**spaced repetition**".  
Doing something 20 times in one day is far less efficient than doing the same thing one time over 20 days.  

We know that short term memory is for something that you're currently working on.  
And you can bring long term memory into your working memory in order to solve problems, consolidating your long term memory.  

To improve knowledge acquisition and retention, new information must be consolidated and securely stored in our long term memory.  

**NOTE**:  
In this course, we can think of Short Term Memory and Working Memory as the same thing.  
However for those interested in the details you can read about the specific differences here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/

## Active vs Passive Learning

Obviously, active learning is what you need to do in order to become an efficient learner.  
You need to practise, to take notes, to try and solve problems on your own.  

Trying to recall what you've learnt before actually checking if you remembered right is also very important.  

**Practising** and **Recalling** are the 2 most efficient ways of learning. 

## The Science of Motivation

### Intrinsic motivation

We want to progress so we can:
- gain autonomy
- reach mastery
- have a purpose

### Extrinsic motivation

Like money, or any kind of external reward.  

## Goals

Eliminate the fear of failure by taking small steps.   
"Kaizen" is a japanese word for continuous small incremental improvements.  

A famous book about this idea of **compound learning** = "Atomic Habits"

## Chunking

Breaking things down into different chunks is sometimes called **"bottom-up learning"**.  
What we also need is something called **"top-down learning"**, which consists in connecting the dots between these chunks.  
By combining bottom-up learning with top-down learnint, we can create a **mind map** of the specific topic we're studying.  

## Deliberate Practice

You start to learn a topic, and initially you make rapid progress.  
Then eventually you hit what is called a "perceived limit", where you start to plateau.  
When you reach this point where you don't see yourself improving anymore, that's where you need deliberate practice.  
You need to practice and practice again until you break through that limit.  

In order to have deliberate practice, we need:
- specific goals
- intense focus
- immediate feedback
- that frequent discomfort from being at the edge of our abilities

Deliberate practice demands near maximal effort, which is generally not enjoyable.  

## Spaced Repetition

Cramming is not a good strategy, but repeating things over a long period of time is really efficient.  
It helps you build those neural connections which engrave your knowledge in your long term memory.

## Habits as Energy Savers

https://ncase.me/remember/

- try and memorize 5 or 10 cards on the first day
- then test yourself on the next day and move cards to level 2 if you succeed
- test yourself again 2 days later on all cards and if you fail, cards go back to level 1
- test yourself 4 days after that, then 8 days, and so on until cards reach level 8
- when cards reach level 8, it means you should be able to remember their content for ever
- you can add new cards to level 1 regularly and apply the same principle: success = move card one level up, failure = move card back to level 1

To get the most out of spaced repetition, you must make your cards:
- small
- connected
- meaningful

## Be adventurous

Flash News: Monotony is bad for your brain. Try experiencing new things as often as possible.

## Have an endpoint

Planning your finishing time is just as important as planning your working time.

## Be bored

When you're bored, your mind wanders, and you actually need that!  
Being bored allows that diffuse mode of thinking to happen. It allows us to think of creative solutions, to strengthen our neural connections.  

Boredom is both a warning that we're not doing what we want to be doing, and a push that motivates us to switch goals and projects.

# The Techniques

## The Pomodoro Technique

**25 minutes ON, 5 minutes OFF**  

- 25 minutes of focus mode, no interruption  
- 5 minutes of diffuse mode

## Chunk the subject

Breaking down a complex subject into small pieces that are easy to understand or to tackle.  
We can only hold 4 chunks of knowledge in our working memory, which is why it's hard to solve a big problem.  

If you want to become a professional web developer, you need to learn the art of chunking.
